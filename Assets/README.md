## epoHless Dungeon Generator

Thank you for purchasing this asset! :)

Using this Utility is really simple, follow this steps:

1. Create an empty gameObject and assign to it the scripts **'Room Dungeon Generator'**,
  **'Tilemap Visualizer'** and optionally **'Spawn objects On Tilemap'**;
  
2. In the project section click with the right mouse button and create a room data from:
    >Create -> epoHless Dungeon Generator -> Room Data
  
3. Assign the various tilemaps to the **TileMapVisualizer** script;

4. Set the spawnable prefabs in the **'Spawn Objects On Tilemap'** if you want enemies in the scene.
   choose also on what tilemap spawn them;
   
If you are having problems setting up the scene check out the example scene, it's working and with a player already set up
so you can play and test the settings.
